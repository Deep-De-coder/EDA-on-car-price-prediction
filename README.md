# Car Price Prediction - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

## üìã Project Overview

This project performs a comprehensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a car price prediction dataset. The analysis explores various factors that influence car prices, including vehicle specifications, market categories, and performance metrics.

## üéØ Project Objectives

- Analyze the relationship between car features and MSRP (Manufacturer's Suggested Retail Price)
- Identify key factors that influence car pricing
- Perform data cleaning and preprocessing
- Create visualizations to understand data patterns and correlations
- Generate insights for car price prediction models

## üìä Dataset Information

**Dataset:** `data.csv`
- **Size:** 11,914 records √ó 16 features
- **Target Variable:** MSRP (Manufacturer's Suggested Retail Price)
- **Features:** 15 independent variables

## üîß Data Preprocessing Steps

1. **Data Loading & Initial Exploration**
   - Load dataset and examine basic statistics
   - Check data shape and column information

2. **Data Cleaning**
   - Standardize column names (lowercase, replace spaces with underscores)
   - Handle missing values:
     - Market Category: Fill with mode
     - Engine Fuel Type: Fill with mode
     - Engine HP: Fill with mean
     - Engine Cylinders: Fill with median
     - Number of Doors: Fill with median
   - Remove duplicate records

3. **Feature Engineering**
   - Categorize variables into numerical and categorical
   - Standardize categorical variable values

## üìà Analysis Components

### 1. Data Quality Assessment
- Missing value analysis and treatment
- Duplicate record identification and removal
- Data type verification

### 2. Statistical Analysis
- Descriptive statistics for all variables
- Correlation analysis between numerical features
- Distribution analysis of target variable (MSRP)

### 3. Visualization Analysis
- **Distribution Plots:** For all numerical variables
- **Correlation Heatmap:** To identify feature relationships
- **Scatter Plots:** MSRP vs numerical features
- **Bar Plots:** Categorical variables vs MSRP

### 4. Key Insights
- Price distribution patterns
- Feature correlations with MSRP
- Categorical variable impact on pricing
- Market category analysis

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

- **Python 3.x**
